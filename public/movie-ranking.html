<h2>Top 3 movies to stream right now according to the Rotten Tomatoes</h2>
<hr>
<h3>SPACEMAN</h3>
<p>Spaceman definitely isn't for everybody, but it does a decent job of adapting a slow, cerebral story that's easier to engage with in print.</p>
<h3>DAMSEL</h3>
<p>Damsel has an appealing action hero in Millie Bobby Brown, whose gutsy performance is often enough to balance the scales against the film's underpowered story and occasionally unconvincing effects.</p>
<h3>POOR THINGS</h3>
<p>Poor Things is a weird, wild good time and Emma Stone is fantastic in it -- just be prepared for adult themes that may unsettle or offend some viewers.</p>
